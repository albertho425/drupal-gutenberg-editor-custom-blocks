This is a custom Drupal 10 Gutenberg editor custom block for editing text. It's one of several blocks that we would like to enable for content creators.

It allows user to pick text color, font size, and gives character count in the side bar.
When pressing enter key, it gives a new instance of itself. Ideally, it should mimic the core/paragraph block and allow user to select from all blocks. Also when I paste in content, it works normally if it's just text. If there is a heading and text, it will default to the core/heading and core/paragraph block.
