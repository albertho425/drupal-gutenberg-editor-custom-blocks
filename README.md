# Introduction

This is a custom Drupal 10 Gutenberg editor custom block for editing text. It's one of several blocks that we would like to enable for content creators.

## Current features
- allows user to select text color from a specific list of colors
- allow user to select font-size and get character count in the side panel

## To Do
- When pressing enter, mimic core/paragraph and allow user to select any block instead of adding a new instance of itself
- When pasting in content that contains heading and text, it should show up as custom/heading and custom/paragraph instead of core/heading and core/paragraph
